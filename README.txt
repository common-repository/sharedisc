The ShareDisc addon for WooCommerce helps you increase your social networking community/fan base and at the same time improve the sales through giving them discounts. Discount will automatically apply once they share through available social networks. As the store owner you can divide and assign the % amount of discount the shopper can earn for each social network. For example: Social Network 1 = 5%, Social Network 2 = 3%, Social Network 3 = 2% for a total of 10% discount or part there of.

By rewarding sharing, your shoppers will be much more likely to share a product over a social network. Our callout tag grabs their attention and notifies them that there is a discount available for sharing. We’ve seen our existing users easily double their sharing activity by using ShareDisc.
